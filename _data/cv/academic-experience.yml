    - "Northeastern University, Language and Intelligent System Laboratory, Multimodal Team Member"
    - "October 2023 – Present"
    - "Reproduced a Transformer-based multimodal emotion recognition model integrating textual, auditory, and visual information layers."
    - "Enhanced the original model architecture by incorporating Transformer modules for fusion of information from three single-modal layers at each level."
    - "Designed two different forward functions and loss functions for independent and non-independent modalities, and developed classifiers for modality differentiation."
    - "Currently working on completing all experiments and planning to prioritize submission to CCF-B and higher-level conferences (first author) by early May."

- title: "Sepsis Patient Mortality Prediction and Medication Prediction Model"
  description:
    - "Under the Guidance of MIT Professor Manolis Kellis (Team Leader)"
    - "July 2023 – September 2023"
    - "Paper Title: 'Factors that Increase the Mortality of Sepsis and Personalized Medication for Patients with Sepsis'"
    - "Investigated factors affecting sepsis patient mortality rates and medication usage to develop personalized medication prediction models."
    - "Utilized SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc., machine learning algorithms for mortality prediction and feature extraction from the MIMIC IV dataset."
    - "Identified 17 vital signs (e.g., age, respiratory rate) and 7 drugs (e.g., epinephrine, hydrocodone) correlated with patient mortality. Developed personalized medication models achieving an average accuracy of 73%."
    - "Received a rating of A (98/100) from Professor Manolis Kellis and the paper has been published by ACM (first author, indexed by EI)."
